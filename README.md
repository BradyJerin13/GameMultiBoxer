# GameMultiBoxer
A script capable of controlling numerous Multiboxing clients simultaneously.

The only file in this repo that I own is the "Wow Hotkey Script.exe". All other files are property of HotkeyNet which can be found here: http://hotkeynet.com/

The script can be loaded through the HotKeyNet application provided. It can be modified to support any number of open applications and can be used on more applications than just World of Warcraft.

If you have any questions or comments on the script you can email me at: reidhymes@gmail.com
